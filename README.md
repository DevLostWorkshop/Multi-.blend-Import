----How to use----

Once installed, you will navigate to the import option under the File dropdown.

In the import option, select Multi.blend Import

A window will pop up displaying Add .Blend Files. Which then will open the Blender File View

Select all .blend files you wish to import into the scene

Note: the .blend files must be within the same folder. If in other folders, they will need to be imported seperatly per instance

Once .blend files are selected, they will be displayed in a list in the Multi-.blend Import Window

Depending on the files size, blender will take a moment to import.
